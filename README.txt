Updates:

This game is nowhere near what I proposed. The restructuring necessary to get the proposed 
game working did not move along nearly fast enough amongst all of the obligations I had, so 
the path followed instead was to take a mostly-structured submission, and rework it to 
accommodate previous feedback, as well as enhance its capabilities. 
The improvements to my IllusionOfDepth are as follows:
Score and win screen from which game can restart.
Better Language integration than any previous project.
Shader support - red tint on explosions on win screen.
Particles.
Updating individual hamsters - an application of some sort no longer applies to all - 'finding'
	a hamster now stops its animation.
Tweaked additions to Animations, Sprites, Units, and how they can be made.
